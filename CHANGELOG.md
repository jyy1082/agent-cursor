# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) — while
in `0.x`, minor version bumps may include breaking changes.

## [0.7.0] — Rename to page-pilot

### Changed
- **Breaking:** renamed the project from `agent-cursor` to `page-pilot`.
  The exported class is now `PagePilot` (was `AgentCursor`), the error class
  is `PagePilotStopped` (was `AgentCursorStopped`), and the file is
  `page-pilot.js` (was `agent-cursor.js`). Update your imports:
  ```js
  // before
  import { AgentCursor } from './agent-cursor.js'
  // after
  import { PagePilot } from './page-pilot.js'
  ```

## [0.6.0] — Keyboard, hover, drag, and async waiting

### Added
- `pressKey(target, key, options)` — dispatch a real keydown/keyup, with
  optional modifier keys (ctrl/shift/alt/meta).
- `hover(target)` / `unhover()` — trigger mouseenter/mouseover and
  mouseleave/mouseout for tooltips and hover-driven UI.
- `dragTo(source, target, options)` — animated mousedown → mousemove →
  mouseup drag sequence, for mouse-event-based sortable lists, sliders, and
  drag widgets. Accepts an element or a raw `{ x, y }` point as the
  destination.
- `waitFor(target, options)` — poll for a selector (or predicate function)
  to match a visible element before continuing, instead of guessing a fixed
  delay. Supports `timeout`, `interval`, and `visible`, and is abortable via
  `stop()`.
- All four new methods work as `run()` step types (`pressKey`, `hover`,
  `unhover`, `dragTo`, `waitFor`).
- Demo updated with a hover tooltip, an Escape-to-close menu, a
  drag-and-drop chip, and an asynchronously-loaded "Load more" section.

Verified with an 18-case test suite covering all four additions.

## [0.5.0] — Container-scoped page glow

### Added
- `pageGlowTarget` — wrap the page glow around a specific container instead
  of the whole viewport, staying aligned to it across scroll/resize.
- `pageGlowRadius` — rounds the glow's corners, useful when wrapping a
  container that itself has rounded corners.

### Changed
- Demo's page glow now wraps the card container instead of the full browser
  viewport, since the demo's content is a narrow centered column.

## [0.4.0] — stop() and hardening

### Added
- `stop()` — immediately abort whatever's currently running (mid-wait,
  mid-typing, mid-scroll, anywhere) and drop anything still queued. The
  instance stays fully usable right after, no reset needed.
- `AgentCursorStopped` error class (later renamed `PagePilotStopped`) for
  distinguishing an intentional stop from a real failure.
- A Stop button in the demo.

### Fixed
- The page glow could get stuck on permanently after `stop()` interrupted a
  step mid-flight, due to an active-step counter drifting negative. Now
  clamped at 0.
- `stop()` interrupting a scroll (with `showScrollIndicator: true`) could
  leave the direction-arrow badge stuck on screen forever. `stop()` now
  cleans it up.
- Added a fallback for environments without `element.scrollTo()`, and made
  `contenteditable` detection more robust (checks the attribute as well as
  `isContentEditable`).

Verified with a 29-case test suite covering every public method.

## [0.3.0] — Page glow

### Added
- `showPageGlow` — a pulsing colored border around the whole viewport for
  as long as any step is running, a "the system is driving this" signal.
  Off by default. Configurable via `pageGlowColor` and `pageGlowWidth`.

## [0.2.0] — Broader form and framework support

### Added
- `check()` now supports custom ARIA switch components (`role="switch"` /
  `aria-checked`), not just native checkbox/radio inputs.
- `type()` now supports `contenteditable` elements (rich-text editors,
  custom div-based inputs), not just `<input>`/`<textarea>`.
- `showCursorDot: false` to skip the moving cursor dot entirely and keep
  only ripple/highlight feedback.
- `showScrollIndicator` (default off) to optionally show a small direction
  arrow during `scroll()`.
- `hideCursor()` / `showCursor()`; `run()` now auto-hides the cursor once a
  full sequence finishes.

### Fixed
- `select()` now uses the native property setter (like `type()` already
  did) so React-controlled `<select>` elements fire `onChange` correctly.

### Documentation
- Added a "Framework compatibility" section covering React/Vue behavior.
- Made the project description tool-agnostic (no longer references any
  specific third-party automation framework).

## [0.1.0] — Initial release

### Added
- Core interaction methods: `click()`, `type()`, `select()` (including
  multi-select), `check()` (checkbox/radio), `chooseOption()` (custom
  dropdowns), `scroll()` (window or container, by amount or to an edge).
- Animated virtual cursor with click ripple feedback.
- Persistent highlight borders on every acted-on element, with
  `clearHighlight()` / `clearHighlights()`.
- `run(steps)` to execute an ordered batch of steps.
- `step(target, action)` escape hatch for fully custom logic.
- Interactive `demo.html` covering every control type.

### Fixed
- A highlight box could jump to the top-left corner if the acted-on element
  hid itself as a side effect of being clicked (e.g. a dropdown option that
  closes its own menu).
- The demo's custom dropdown didn't open on the first click, due to a
  state-comparison bug against an unset inline style.
